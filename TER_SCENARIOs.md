# SCENARIO 1 - THE CLOSEST PLANET TO EARTH

## 1. The Question

**Question:** What is the closest planet to Earth?

**Why choose this question?**  
This question was selected because it strikes an ideal balance: it is not overly difficult (users, with some reasoning, can arrive at the correct answer), but it is not too simple either. A question that is too easy would make an incorrect suggestion obvious, leading to its rejection in most cases. This balance increases the likelihood that the user will consider the suggestion, even if it is not entirely accurate.

The application will randomly suggest one of the following two options:

- The closest planet to the Earth is **Mercury** (correct answer).
- The closest planet to the Earth is **Neptune** (incorrect and almost absurd answer).

**Goal:**  
To observe how users respond to the suggestion:
- Accepts the suggestion only when it is correct.
- Rejects the suggestion regardless of its correctness and formulates their own reasoning (e.g., if they think the closest planet is Mars).
- Accepts the suggestion in any case out of speed, convenience, or laziness.

## 3. Experiment Design

### **Hello**
Small presentation and request to participate in application testing.  
**Example:**  
"Hi, my name is Leonardo. Do you want to test a new AI application?"

### **Exposition of the Task**
Explain to people:
- **Who I am:** "I’m Leonardo Digirolamo."
- **For whom I work:** "I work for OpenAI, and we want to have some feedback about the beta version of this new AI application."
- **What the application does:** "This application is similar to ChatGPT but helps you to write a text. You can start to write something, and it will suggest to you the correct continuation of the sentence."

### **Description of the Task**
1. Fill out a small questionnaire to help analyze the results.
2. Test the application firsthand to verify its functionality by answering the question:  
   *“What is the closest planet to Earth?”*  
   Write: "The closest planet to the Earth is…" and observe the suggestions. Choose to:
   - Validate it by pressing `TAB`.
   - Continue writing if the suggestion is incorrect.
   - Notice how the suggestions might update.

### **Execution of the Task**
The user executes the task independently.

### **Debriefing**
After the experiment:
- Explain the real nature of the experiment.
- Review the user’s answer and ask:
  - Why did you give this answer? Did you follow the suggestion?  
  - If the answer is wrong and you followed a suggestion, why?  
  - If the answer is correct and you didn’t follow the suggestion, why?  
  - Did you feel a conflict between accepting and refusing the suggestion? If yes, why?

# SCENARIO 2 - THE LENGTH OF THE BLUE WHALE

## 1. The Question

**Question:** What is the length of a blue whale?

**Why choose this question?**  
This question was selected because it represents a scenario where an average person might not know the exact answer but can reasonably deduce the most plausible option when faced with two significantly different choices.

The application will randomly suggest one of the following two options:

- The length of the blue whale is **30 meters** (correct answer).
- The length of the blue whale is **150 meters** (incorrect and almost absurd answer).

**Goal:**  
To observe how users respond to the suggestion:
- Accepts the suggestion only when it is correct.
- Rejects the suggestion regardless of its correctness and formulates their own reasoning about the whale's size.
- Accepts the suggestion in any case out of speed, convenience, or laziness.
