# How do people use Copilot?

## GitHub Copilot Official Site
The Copilot is described in terms of its functionalities but does not provide recommendations on the best way to use it. Similarly, the "Frequently Asked Questions" section does not include user inquiries about how to make the most of it.

## Continue
The documentation for the "Continue" Copilot includes a section titled "How to use it." However, this section merely explains how to enable the Copilot within the IDE and lists the commands for managing the provided suggestions.

It does not offer guidance on how users can make the most of it to achieve optimal performance, better suggestions, and an improved user experience.

## Microsoft Learn - Get better responses by setting the context for GitHub Copilot Chat in Visual Studio
This Microsoft Learn article provides recommendations on how to obtain better responses from the Copilot by including specific information, such as context, the type of response expected (e.g., explanation, generation), or modifying the source used by Copilot to generate responses.

However, this approach is not relevant to our case, as in our static application, users cannot manage these parameters. Instead, we are interested in understanding how users interact with text input: how many characters they type before expecting a response, how long they wait, and how soon they resume typing if no suggestion is provided.

## GitHub Community
From the analysis of various questions and issues discussed on *GitHub Community*, it becomes clear that users expect to receive a suggestion after they stop typing, rather than while they are still writing.  
Their behavior follows this pattern:  
- They type  
- They stop typing and wait for a suggestion to complete what they have written  

## Possible Questions to Ask Copilot Users
Not finding any specific information while searching, I've compiled some questions for GitHub Copilot users.

**Questions:**
- How many characters do you type before waiting for a suggestion?
- How long do you wait for a suggestion before resuming typing?
